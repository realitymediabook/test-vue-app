    Google Maps has been a popular navigational app on smart phones since 2008. Since 
2019, Live View has permitted users to see directional arrows in AR, overlayed on the camera's 
view of their surroundings. The arrows help to orient the user and follow the route indicated on 
their flat Google maps.
