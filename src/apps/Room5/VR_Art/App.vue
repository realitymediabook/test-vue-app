	 Since the 1990s, digital art (and especially digital installation art) has won 
increasing acceptance in the larger art community. Virtual reality, 360-degree, and augmented 
reality media art are exhibited at various galleries and museums across the world. Digital artists 
still often exhibit in their own festivals, shows, or galleries, such as ISEA International or more 
permanent collections such as at Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria.</div>
