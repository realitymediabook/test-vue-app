Each gallery in this “immersive book” corresponds to one or more chapters in the printed book and illustrates the themes of the printed chapter(s). (See the map on the far wall for the names/themes of the galleries.) For example, the gallery entitled “Presence” illustrates both presence and the related concept of aura and how computer scientists as well as filmmakers and designers have tried to evoke these reactions in visitors to their immersive applications.
