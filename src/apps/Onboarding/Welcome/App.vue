	<div class="squareoff"> <i>Reality Media</i> is a project encompassing three writing spaces, three technologies for representing ideas: print, the web, and immersive VR. The printed page is a writing space with a tradition dating back to the fifteenth century (in Europe, much earlier in China). Obviously the web has a far shorter tradition, beginning around 1990. But in the thirty year since Tim Berners-Lee launched the first web server, the web has grown to rival print for many kinds of communication. The technologies for creating 3D graphic spaces in VR (and AR) actually predate the web. But only in the past 10 years have AR and VR become widely available media. The goal of RealityMedia is to demonstrate the potential range of AR and VR as communicative forms.
