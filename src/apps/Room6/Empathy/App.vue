	<div class="squareoff">Researchers have long pursued the idea of emotional reactions such as empathy as a test of presence. 
 VR is  understood as getting us closer to the authentic or the real. But forgetting the medium is not necessary for a sense of presence. Presence can be understood in a more nuanced way as a liminal zone between forgetting and acknowledging VR as a medium.
