    <p>In 1930s, Walter Benjamin introduced the concept of <span style="fontWeight:700">aura</span> in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. 
  Aura is the  <span style="fontWeight:700">here and now</span> that work possesses because of its unique history of production and transmission. </p>
  <br>
  <p>AR applications are not perfect reproductive technologies, as some draw on the physical and cultural uniquesness, <em>the here and now</em> of particular places. </p>
