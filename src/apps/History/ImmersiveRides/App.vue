The first motion simulator platform was made in 1910 and was a model aircraft connected to the ground by a universal joint. When the wind blew, the plane's flaps could be used to rotate the plane so pilots could get practice without having to go into the air. In 1929, Edwin Link made a new simulator, that used a platform with inflating and deflating bellows below it to rotate the platform. In 1958, the Comet 4 was developed using hydraulics and had 3 degrees of freedom. As these motion simulators, which were at the time mainly used for training, grew, they started to be used for various new things. In 1977, the Doron SR2 simulator ride was made, which was an enclosed cockpit with a screen on the inside, which could be used to project a first-person view, while hydraulics pitched the ride around. This allowed for the simulation of movement while giving the people inside a first-person view of the vehicle that the ride would simulate.
