Invented in 1832 by Charles Wheatstone, the <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.3rem;">stereoscope,</span> was handheld device that displayed separate drawings or photographs in each eye. As a reality medium, the stereoscope remediates the flat photograph in order to achieve the illusion of depth. Oliver Wendel Holmes created an inexpensive version in 1861 that remained popular for a century. The model on the dais is an approximate replica of the Holmes stereoscope.
