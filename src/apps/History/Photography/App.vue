Joseph Nicéphore Niépce created the earliest surviving photograph in the 1820s, using a camera obscura to project an image onto a pewter plate. Photography was quickly recognized as a medium with a special claim to capturing the real. As the British pioneer Fox Talbot put in his illustrated essay <span style="font-style:italic">The Pencil of Nature</span> (1844–1846), a photograph was an image “impressed by Nature’s hand.”
