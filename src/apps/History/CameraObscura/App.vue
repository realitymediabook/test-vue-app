The <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.3rem;">camera obscura</span> was originally a darkened room with a small hole that projected an inverted image of the outside scene on to the opposite wall. A later version (from the 17th century to the 19th) was a portable box, often with a lens to focus the light. The image produced was ephemeral until in the 19th century the image could be captured on a chemically treated surface: the camera obscura became the photographic camera.
