Around 1425, the Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated how linear perspective could make painting into a reality medium. Using his perspective technique, he painted the Florence Baptistry on a small wooden panel. Looking through a small hole in the panel, he could see the picture reflected in a mirror. When he took the mirror away, he could see the actual Baptistry. This procedure allowed him to measure his technique in relation to the building itself.
