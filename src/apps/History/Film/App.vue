The first fully dynamic reality media was seen in the 1890s, when the Lumière brothers created <span style="font-style:italic">cinématographe</span>. With this device, they made a series of early films, including 'The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station', which showcased their success in reproducing a facet of reality that still photography could not, by using the persistence of vision phenonomenon to create the illusion of motion.
