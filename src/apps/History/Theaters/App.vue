3D films are motion pictures that are made to give an illusion of three-dimensional depth with the help of 3D glasses worn by viewers. Using color filters or polarized lenses, the 3D glasses send different perspectives of the same image to each eye of the viewer to emulate the illusion of depth. </div>
