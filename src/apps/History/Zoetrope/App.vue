Dating from the 1830s, the <span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:1.3rem;">zoetrope</span> was one of the pre-filmic devices that produced the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawing or photographs. It is consisted of a cylinder with vertical slits along the sides. The inner surface of the cylinder featured a row of sequential images. When the cylinder rotated at just the right speed, the viewer could look through one of the slits to experience the illusion of motion.
