 In 1962, the American media technologist and filmmaker, Morton Heilig, created the Sensorama, a unique prototype for immersive experiences. The device was a high-tech, multi-sensory nickelodeon, including video, stereo sound, tactile and even olfactory feedback. The user sat with their head in the viewport and could, for example, experience the sensations of riding a motorcycle, including the feel of the wind in their hair and the smells of the open road. Heilig's Sensorama was a remediation of cinema of the time, but it  was also an expression of the desire for fully immersive virtual reality, which the computing pioneer Ivan Sutherland was pursuing in that same decade (see the Ultimate Display exhibit to your right) .
