 Conceived by English painter Robert Barker, the panorama was an 18th-century reality medium. Barker used perspective techniques to create a panorama on a canvas stretched around the cylindrical surface. Standing on a raised platform in the middle, viewers had a  fully immersive experience. Panoramic exibitions showing cities, landscapes, and historical battles conitnued to be popular throughout the 19th century.
