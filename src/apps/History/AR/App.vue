Sutherland’s ‘The Sword of Damocles’ depicted on level 2 is often considered the first head-mounted display for AR as well as VR. However, AR could not achieve its current status in our media culture until mobile phones with good graphics capabilities became widely avaible in the 2010s. Then, applications for games (e.g.Pokemon Go), navigation (e.g. Google Live View), social media (e.g. Instagram Stories AR Filter), and commerce (e.g. Ikea Place) all became possible.
