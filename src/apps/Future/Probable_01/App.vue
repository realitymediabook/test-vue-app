The probable future is what is likely to occur unless there are some extreme events. Existing technologies will keep improving and social practices, government policies, and business strategies will remain in their current directions. The future is likely to resemble the present state of AR and VR but with more advanced advancements in technologies and devices. For instance, VR is projected to incorporate more powerful graphics processors (GPUs) and increased memory, enabling more immersive, realistic, and responsive 3D graphics.

<br /><br />
Moreover, the rapid progress in AI is set to revolutionize communication within VR environments. Advances in AI, particularly in the realm of natural language processing and machine learning, will facilitate real-time language translations. This will be particularly beneficial in VR environments, where people from all over the world can easily converse with each other.
