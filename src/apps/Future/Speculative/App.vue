	 In this gallery, we explore the potential futures of AR and VR technologies, through the lens of speculative design outlined by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby in their book  <span class="oblique">‘Speculative Everything’</span> (2013), which was borrowed from the designer Stewart Candy. According to Dunne and Raby, the futures we imagine through speculative design are not necessarily destinations to be achieved, but rather a medium for exploration and experimentation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the gallery, you will find three exhibitions, each showcasing a different future of AR and VR: <span style="font-weight:700">Probable, Plausible, and Possible.</span> As you explore each exhibit, you will get a glimpse into how we envision the future of AR and VR in various areas such as entertainment, education, healthcare, communication, and many more. This experience will not only give you a chance to see the state of the art in VR and AR but also speculate what can be possible with the technology that has yet to be invented.
