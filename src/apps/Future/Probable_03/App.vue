VR is a promising technology for rehabilitation as it encourages patients to use their bodies to play in engaging scenarios. Furthermore, VR could be integrated with wearable sensors for robust body tracking, enhancing rehabilitation programs. Additionally, VR's ability to create realistic and highly controllable environments can assist patients with anxiety disorders, traumas, and phobias, as it can provide exposure therapy in a safe and controlled manner.

As for AR, it will likely become a common part of medical care. During surgical procedures, for example, AR could provide surgeons with necessary information while allowing them to use both hands to perform the procedure. By overlaying real-time data and visuals onto their field of view, AR can enhance surgical precision and streamline the decision-making process. </div>
