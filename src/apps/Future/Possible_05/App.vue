It is possible that a digital twin or 3-D replica of the physical world in which every building, street, town, and the city is available and everyone can have their own version of it. Users will have the ability to change the visual style of their virtual environment easily and in real time. Imagine a scenario where users dynamically switch between different visual styles, such as realistic, cartoonish, futuristic, or even artistic interpretations of the virtual world. With just a few simple adjustments, people transform the entire ambiance, color palette, lighting effects, and overall aesthetics of their virtual environment.
