  <span style="font-size:2rem; font-weight:700;">Dunne and Raby's</span> concept represented by nested cones is a useful way of visualizing the likelihood of different possible futures. 
  <br/><br/>
  The outermost cone represents the realm of the <span style="font-weight:700;">possible</span>, which encompasses all possible outcomes that do not contradict known physical laws or human limitations. This cone is the largest, representing the widest range of potential futures.   
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The middle cone represents the <span style="font-weight:700;">plausible</span>, which includes all outcomes that seem reasonably likely to occur given the current state of the world and our understanding of it. This cone is smaller than the outermost cone, representing a narrower range of potential futures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The innermost cone represents the <span style="font-weight:700;">probable</span>, which includes all outcomes that seem most likely to occur given current trends and conditions. This cone is the smallest, representing the narrowest range of potential futures.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <!--In this way, Dunne and Raby's diagram illustrates that as we move further into the future, the number of possible outcomes decreases, while the number of likely outcomes increases. It provides a framework for understanding how uncertainty and likelihood change as we look further into the future.-->
