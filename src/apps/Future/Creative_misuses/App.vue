<span class="wavy">YouTube</span> originally envisioned as a platform for sharing short amateur videos, has expanded its scope and transformed into a hub for a diverse range of content. The platform now serves as a space where individuals can showcase their expertise, share educational resources, and entertain global audiences. This expansion attracted not only amateur creators but professional creators such as educators and entertainers. 
<br /><br />
Similarly, <span class="wavy">Facebook</span> has transcended its original intent as a social networking site. It has grown into a multifaceted platform that encompasses political campaigns, news dissemination, content creation, fundraising, and much more.
