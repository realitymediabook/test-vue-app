More of the social interaction and events will transfer to VR. We are already witnessing the early stages of this transformation with platforms like Meta Horizon. Also, with improved speech recognition through machine learning, AI avatars in VR will become more responsive and capable of managing virtual social spaces. This will make virtual interactions feel more realistic and lifelike, allowing individuals to connect, collaborate and socialize in new ways, regardless of their physical location. 
<br/><br/>
Moreover, VR will evolve to analyze users' facial expressions, body language, and voice patterns, facilitating real-time emotion recognition. This data can be mapped to virtual avatar animations, resulting in a more accurate portrayal of emotions. Such advancements can make social interactions in VR feel more emotionally rich.     </div>
