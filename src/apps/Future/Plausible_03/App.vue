With AR glasses, people will be able to self-diagnose their physical health, by detecting vital signs, monitoring body movements, and analyzing other health-related data in real-time. The built-in communication capabilities will enable people to share this information with the doctor.

In the future, VR therapy will be a part of daily life for most people. Furthermore, VR could enable surgeons to perform complex surgeries remotely through telepresence. Using advanced haptic feedback and robotic surgical systems, surgeons could control robotic instruments while experiencing a realistic 3D virtual representation of the patient's anatomy in VR. This could allow collaboration between surgeons with different areas of expertise, regardless of their locations. </div>    </div>
