It is plausible that we will see more people engaging in virtual activities such as virtual marriages, where couples create a virtual ceremony that mimics a real-life wedding and invites virtual guests. The use of VR in this context could also provide a new way for people to connect, and experience life events together, regardless of their physical location.<br/><br/>
In the realm of AR, overlaying virtual filters or visualizations can offer individuals a unique way to express their emotions and thoughts visually. Moreover, AR technology will enable users to simulate the sensory experiences of others, such as seeing through the eyes of a person with color blindness. This could foster understanding and empathy. Additionally, AI-powered AR assistants could analyze speech patterns and facial expressions of others, enabling them to detect emotional states and provide valuable support during conversations and interactions. </div>
