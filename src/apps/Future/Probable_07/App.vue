We will likely see a new trend emerge in fashion. The increasing use of AR and VR in daily life will create a demand for clothing and accessories that are designed specifically for these virtual spaces. This could include clothing that enhances the appearance of avatars, or accessories that provide added functionality within the virtual world. Additionally, people may start to wear VR head-mounted displays and AR glasses as fashionable accessories, similar to how smartphones and smartwatches are worn today.
