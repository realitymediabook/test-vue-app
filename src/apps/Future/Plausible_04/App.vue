New types of sports will be invented that can be only played in virtual environments. These new VR sports could include a wide variety of activities, from traditional sports adapted to a virtual environment to entirely new forms of competition that are only possible in VR. As technology becomes more mainstream, it's possible that these VR sports could become popular enough to be included in the Olympics and other major sports events. The introduction of VR sports could also open up new opportunities for people who have physical limitations, as they would be able to participate in sports and competitions in a virtual environment.
