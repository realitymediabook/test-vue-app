	<div class="squareoff">In January 1896, an audience in a basement room of the Grand Café in Paris attended one of the first public showings of films created by Auguste and Louis Lumière. One of these was The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, a fifty-second film in which a steam engine and several passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. The story goes that some in the audience panic. Imagining that the train is going to burst out of the screen into the room, they leave their seats and rush for the door.
