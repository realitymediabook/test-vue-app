	<div class="squareoff">As film historian Tom Gunning argues, the audience probably did not believe in the reality of the train. They were astonished, not fooled, because they had never seen a medium so real. Yet they still new they were experiencing a medium. This knowing astonishment is what we call the La Ciotat effect, and it is the effect  that each reality medium has. Each reality medium mediates and remediates. It offers a new representation of the world that we implicitly compare  to our experience of the world in itself, but also through other media.</div>
