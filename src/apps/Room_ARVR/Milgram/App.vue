In the 1990s, when both VR and AR were still laboratory technologies, two researchers, Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, diagrammed what they called the virtuality continuum, a spectrum with the real environment (the physical world) at one end and the complete virtual environment (VR) at the other (Milgram and Kishino 1994; Milgram et al. 1995). They placed augmented reality and augmented virtuality as intermediate points between these endpoints.
