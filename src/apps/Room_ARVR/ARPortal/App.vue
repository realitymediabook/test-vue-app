This AR portal demonstrates all four points on the Milgram and Kishino continuum, the "real environment", augmented reality, augmented virtuality, and virtual reality (created by @nedd on YouTube). If you are on the street side, you are in augmented reality, where most of the scene is the physical world. Walk through the portal and you are in a virtual world. Look back through the portal and you get a view of the physical world embedded in that virtual world: this would be augmented virtuality.
