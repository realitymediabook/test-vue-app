   In 1984, Jaron Lanier founded VPL Research, one of the first companies to build and market VR systems. VPL Research pioneered systems and techniques. The VPL’s Eyephone headset presented a polished version of the technology that was well-suited to Hollywood’s notion of VR as a sci-fi technology in the Star Wars decade. Comparing the Eyephone to Ivan Sutherland’s Sword of Damocles, we see not only how far the technology had progressed since the late 1960s, but also how it was becoming oriented to a world of entertainment and popular consumption.</div>
